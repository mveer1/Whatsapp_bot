# We'll write the path app.route('/', methods = ['POST']) for it. This decorator means that our home function will be called every time our FLASK server is accessed through a post request by the main path.

# We are testing the fact that the server was accessed through the POST method. Now we create an instance of our bot and submit JSON data to it.

# requests.json â€“ lets you get JSON files from the request body sent to our server.
